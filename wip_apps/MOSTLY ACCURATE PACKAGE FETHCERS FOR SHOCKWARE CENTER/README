These new python scripts pull in a lot more apt packages, and MOST of them are in the right language. There is still a bit of touching up to do, because some of it is in a completely whacky language that is not even close to the current locale. Right now it just finds ANY name, regardless of the locale, if it can't find one that matches the current locale. There's gotta be a more accurate way to get ALL the names in the system language without eliminating most of the packages from the selection.
