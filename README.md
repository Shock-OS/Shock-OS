=========================================================== STEPS TO INSTALL SHOCK OS FROM GITHUB ====================================================================================
If you wish to manually build Shock OS instead of using one of the ready-made images, this guide will tell you how to do so.

STEP 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32 bit or 64 bit) on a SD card, USB stick or USB HDD/SSD.

STEP 2: When prompted, create the 'shock' user (username: shock, password: shock)

STEP 3: Download the code from your desired branch into a .ZIP file and extract it, then make a .deb file out of it using dpkg-deb.

STEP 4: Install the created .deb file on Shock OS using: sudo apt install ./[DEB PACKAGE NAME]

That's it!
